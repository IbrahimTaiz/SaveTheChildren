# Informational Website for a Non-Profit Organization

## Project Goal
This project aims to build a professional static website for a non-profit organization, focusing on semantic HTML, accessibility (WAI-ARIA), responsive CSS designs, and advanced JavaScript for interactivity, data handling, and performance.

## Technologies Used
*   **HTML5:** For semantic structure.
*   **CSS3:** For styling, including Flexbox, CSS Grid, and custom animations.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and responsive design.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript:** For all interactive functionalities, DOM manipulation, data fetching, and form validation.
*   **Leaflet.js:** An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.

## Implementation Details

This section details how each requirement from the project brief was addressed.

### Project Goal Emphasis

*   **Semantic HTML and Accessibility (WAI-ARIA):**
    *   **Implementation:** HTML5 semantic tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<form>`, `<ul>`, `<h3>`, etc.) are used throughout `index.html` to provide meaningful structure.
    *   **Accessibility (WAI-ARIA):** Basic ARIA attributes have been integrated:
        *   `role="navigation"` and `aria-label="Main navigation"` for the main navigation.
        *   `aria-label` for interactive buttons (e.g., menu toggle, dark mode toggle, login button).
        *   `aria-current="page"` is dynamically set on the active navigation link in `js/script.js`.
        *   `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, and `aria-labelledby` for the login modal to enhance screen reader experience.
        *   `aria-required="true"` for all required form input fields in the contact and donation forms.
        *   `aria-live="polite"` for error messages to ensure screen readers announce validation feedback.
    *   **Future Improvement:** A comprehensive accessibility audit and further refinement of ARIA roles/attributes could be performed for full compliance.

*   **Responsive and Aesthetic CSS Designs:**
    *   **Implementation:** Tailwind CSS is used, providing a utility-first approach to build responsive layouts with Flexbox and CSS Grid. The design adapts to different screen sizes.
    *   **Animations:**
        *   **Scroll-based animations:** Sections fade in and slide up when they enter the viewport using the Intersection Observer API (`js/script.js`) and custom CSS keyframes (`src/input.css`).
        *   **Hover effects:** Project cards include a subtle `transform` and `box-shadow` transition on hover (`src/input.css`).
    *   **Fluid Typography:** A basic `clamp()` function is applied to the `body` font size in `src/input.css` to demonstrate fluid typography.
    *   **Future Improvement:** More complex animations, custom CSS variables (beyond Tailwind's configuration), and a deeper dive into fluid typography for various elements could be explored.

*   **Advanced JavaScript for Interactivity, Data, and Performance:**
    *   **Implementation:** All interactivity is handled by Vanilla JavaScript in `js/script.js`.
    *   **DOM Interactions:**
        *   **Event Delegation:** Used for navigation links and project card filtering.
        *   `document.createDocumentFragment()`: Utilized for efficient DOM updates when loading blog posts.
    *   **Dynamic Content & Data Fetching:** Blog posts are fetched asynchronously from `assets/data/blog.json` using `fetch` and `async/await` and rendered dynamically.
    *   **Form Validation:** Comprehensive client-side validation is implemented for both the contact and donation forms, providing real-time feedback to the user.
    *   **Client-side Routing (SPA-like feel):** The website functions as a Single-Page Application. Navigation clicks update the URL hash and dynamically show/hide content sections without full page reloads.
    *   **Local Storage:** Used to persist the dark/light mode preference and simulated login credentials.
    *   **Performance Utilities:** A `debounce` utility function is included in `js/script.js` as an example of performance optimization techniques.
    *   **Future Improvement:** Implementing `throttle` utility, more complex data algorithms (e.g., sorting blog posts by date, searching within blog content), and advanced UI state management patterns.

### Suggested Website Pages (Implemented as Sections)

*   **Home Page (`#home`):** Includes a welcome message and call-to-action.
*   **About Us Page (`#about`):** Features sections for Mission, Vision, Values, Team Profiles (with dummy images), and Organization History.
*   **Contact Us Page (`#contact`):** Contains a contact form with JavaScript validation and contact details (email, phone, address, social media links).
*   **Projects or Programs Page (`#projects`):** Displays a grid of project cards with images, titles, and summaries. Includes a filtering mechanism (All, Education, Health, etc.) to dynamically show/hide projects. Clickable cards open a modal with more details.
*   **Blog or News Page (`#blog`):** Dynamically loads and displays blog posts from `blog.json`, showing title, date, and summary.
*   **Testimonials or Success Stories Page (`#testimonials`):** Presents a grid of dummy testimonials from beneficiaries, volunteers, and partners.
*   **Donate Page (`#donate`):** Features a simulated donation form with client-side validation for the amount and optional donor details.
*   **Map Page (`#map`):** Integrates an interactive map using Leaflet.js, displaying dummy project locations with markers and popups.

## How to Run/View the Project

1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable).
2.  **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal.
3.  **Ensure Node.js and npm (or yarn) are installed.**
4.  **Build the CSS (Tailwind CSS):**
    ```bash
    npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch
    ```
    Keep this command running in a separate terminal window during development to recompile CSS changes.
5.  **Open `index.html`** in your web browser.

The website should now function as a single-page application, with interactive elements and dynamic content.
